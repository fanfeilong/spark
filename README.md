## 🎯 Application Architecture

### Demo System

Each demo showcases different aspects of Spark.js integrated with AI capabilities:

```javascript
// Example: AI-powered 3D scene manipulation
import * as THREE from "three";
import { SplatMesh } from "@sparkjsdev/spark";

// Load 3D model with Spark.js
const splatMesh = new SplatMesh({ url: "model.spz" });
scene.add(splatMesh);

// Future: AI integration
// const aiResponse = await processNaturalLanguage("Make the butterfly larger");
// applyAIModifications(splatMesh, aiResponse);
```

### AI Integration Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Interactive 3D demos with manual controls ✅
- **Phase 2**: Natural language processing for 3D manipulation 🚧
- **Phase 3**: Real-time AI content generation 📋
